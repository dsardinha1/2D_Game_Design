What is the purpose of the program?

    This project is a simple python side scrolling platformer that is used to get familiar with python language. This
simple game called "Quacker's Hunt" uses the arcade python library to project a small arcade style game. All audio and
images for the game were created by myself or otherwise stated in the source code of the game to give proper accreditation.


How do I Use the program?

    Download the .zip of the project and open arcadeGame.py file using python3.7 and arcade module installed. This program
currently only moves the player sprite up and down the screen, while with the background images scrolling to the left.

What keys to use?

    By using the 'W' or 'UP' arrow key will move the player upward while 'S' or "DOWN" arrow key will move the player downwards.
When pressing the 'SPACE' bar, a small spear sprite will move in front of the player and move across the screen to the right.
When the spear is in the air, an audio sound effect will play in the background to give the illusion of the spear being
thrown.
