What is the purpose of the program?

    This project is a simple python side scrolling platformer that is used to get familiar with python language. This
simple game called "Quacker's Hunt" uses the arcade python library to project a small arcade style game. All audio and
images for the game were created by myself or otherwise stated in the source code of the game to give proper accreditation.


How do I Use the program?

    Download the .zip of the project and open arcadeGame.py file using python3.7 and arcade module installed. This program
currently only moves the player sprite up and down the screen, while with the background images scrolling to the left.

What keys to use?

    By using the 'W' or 'UP' arrow key will move the player upward while 'S' or "DOWN" arrow key will move the player downwards.
When pressing the 'SPACE' bar, a small spear sprite will move in front of the player and move across the screen to the right.
When the spear is in the air, an audio sound effect will play in the background to give the illusion of the spear being
thrown.

How the game works?
    There are two types of enemies in this side scroller being small ghosts that shoot energy blasts. The first type spawns a blue ghost sprite that
occasionally fires throughout the game and can be killed in one hit. Only after does the player scores more than 1,000 points will the second type spawn.
The second type is a red ghost sprite of the same style that initially spawns outside of the screen and moves to the left slowly
as they fire towards the player. This version of the enemy can be kill in two shots. If at anytime the player is hit by the enemy's energy blast,
the player will die and a game over screen will pop up. In order to win the game, the player must score more than 5,000 points to have a cheery victory tone played
to award your great effort. Good luck and happy hunting! :)
